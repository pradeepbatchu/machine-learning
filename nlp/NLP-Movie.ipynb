       " 'When I discovered that Pretty Poison had opened without advance publicity or screenings, I rushed to see it, because a movie that makes the movie companies so nervous they’re afraid to show it to the critics stands an awfully good chance of being an interesting movie. Mediocrity and stupidity certainly don’t scare them; talent does. This is a remarkable first feature film by a gifted young American, Noel Black — a movie that should have opened in an art house — and it was playing in a vast and empty theatre, from which, no doubt, it will depart upon the week. And the losses will be so heavy that the movie companies will use this picture as another argument against backing young American directors. The television ads for Pretty Poison are a pitiful attempt to make it seem strident and coarse and brutal — to attract teen-agers by passing it off as a cross between Psycho and Bonnie and Clyde. Those attracted this way are likely to hate the film. Pretty Poison simply isn’t a picture for a big theatre; it doesn’t have the zing to be popular with large audiences. Lorenzo Semple, Jr., has written an unobtrusively thoughtful and well-controlled script — the best script of any American movie this year. Black’s subdued direction has the uncorrupted sensitivity that, given the way movies are made and sold, and what the public seems to want, doesn’t last long. Although Pretty Poison is a psychological thriller, it is modulated and fine-drawn, and (simply because of the way it was thought out and felt out) it presupposes an attentive, intelligent audience. Whether there is an audience for an American picture of this kind is doubtful, because the audience that might respond to it expects American movies to be loud and vulgar, and escapes to quiet foreign pictures. Feeling snug in this division, they don’t go to a subtle or quiet American picture when one comes along, so our movies get shriller all the time, and an American director who makes a movie on the assumption that the audience is as intelligent and sensitive as he is is a beautiful dreamer. (Yet can an artist work any other way?)']"
